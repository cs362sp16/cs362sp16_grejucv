I tested the village function using my card test from assignment 2.
When you have an action and then you use a village card, you should have two actions 
left. But I was getting three actions left. Your village function was giving me two 
additional actions, but I also should have lost an action after using it. 
Below is my test: 

testing village_function()
Number of actions left: 1
Playing village card
Number of actions left: 3
TEST FAILED: Should have two additional actions

The severity of this bug is low, but the priority is high. The game can still 
be played all the way through, and all players will get an additional card. But 
it should be fixed immediately because having an extra action will change the flow of play.
