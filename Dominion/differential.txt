I tested my dominion code with the dominion code from the Hammockt repo. I did not fix anything in my dominion code, so it was full of bugs. His dominion code seemed to be working without any errors. We did not produce the same results. I was struggling to get over 60% code coverage. I was able to finish the game and get over 70% with his version of the dominion game. A big problem with my game is that the scores would reset sometimes for the players. This would throw the entire game off.
