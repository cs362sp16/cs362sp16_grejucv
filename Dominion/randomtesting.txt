I tested adventurer, outpost, and steward. Each test suite was running 1,000 tests. I wrote my random testers by randomizing the number of players, the seed, the choices, and the player who would begin the game. I had set fault sometimes when  Iran my tests, but it was inconsistent, and I wasn’t able to find out why. My overall coverage after using random testers went to 55.35%. With the unit tests I wrote I was getting 47%. My random testers were able to increase my coverage from assignment 2, but I didn’t get to 100%. The .out files show which tests were being run, and the pass/failure stats.
